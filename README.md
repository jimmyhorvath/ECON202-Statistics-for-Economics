# ECON202-Statistics-for-Economics
ECON-202 covered probability, statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression. In our Stata project, we analyzed how income, education, gender, and race/ethnicity affect self-reported health. Our regression showed education and gender as key factors. I learned to interpret statistical results using hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
